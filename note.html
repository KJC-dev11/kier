            My beautiful sunflower, every moment with you is like sunshine for my heart. 
            You fill my world with so much light, love, and happiness. I love spoiling you 
            because you deserve all the love and care in the world. You deserve happiness. 
            And I mean real happiness; true happiness. The kind of happiness that makes your heart fill with warmth. 
            You deserve to feel what it feels like to be okay. To feel like the world isn't against you. To feel like 
            you aren't constantly treading water just to keep from drowning. More than anything, you deserve to be okay. 
            And I know it's hard to hear this, especially when you are so sad. Especially when you are so far away from 
            loving yourself. But I still want you to know. Because one day, you are going to feel okay again. One day you 
            are going to feel happy again. It's just a matter of time. 

            Because you are special, you know that? You're unique. No one has your personality. No one can smile the way 
            you do. The way your laugh lights up when you see something that makes you happy. No one else is like you. 
            No matter how similar someone may look or act like you, no one is truly you. A world without you would be 
            different, no matter how you see it. Every existence holds an importance, both big and small. You're still 
            here for a reason. You're still breathing for a reason. You've continued reading this for a reason. You're 
            having a hard time in life, you've been having hard times in life, life has been hard overall, whichever it is, 
            just remember that you're not alone in this. People mourn everyday for those struggling, those who are hurting. 
            Someone cares about you. And don't say no one does, because I do.

            Don't give up. You are so special to me. You don't even know. I hate when you are hard on yourself because you 
            don't deserve that kind of negativity. You deserve everything good and perfect and sweet and I want to try my 
            best to give that to you. I'm not perfect by any means but I want to be perfect for you. I want to be the best 
            I can for you. I want to help you be the type of person you want. I want to support you as long as you let me. 
            You are very important to me. Thank you for being you. I love you and adore you, my baby sunflower boy. (I try to put rose and orquid but i cant sorry :())
